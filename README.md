# Head First Design Patterns

Summary of design patterns from the Head First Design Patterns book, first edition (October 2004).  
ISBN-13: 978-0596007126

Design Pattern    | Chapter | Purpose
:---------------- | ------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy Pattern  |       1 | Defines a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulating each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
Observer Pattern  |       2 | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
Decorator Pattern |       3 | Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Lessons Learned
1. The one constant in software development is CHANGE.
2. OO Design Principle #1: Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. In other words, take what varies and encapsulate it so it won't affect the rest of your code.
3. OO Design Principle #2: Program to an interface, not an implementation.
4. OO Design Principle #3: Favor composition over inheritance.
5. OO Design Principle #4: Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
6. OO Design Principle #5: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
