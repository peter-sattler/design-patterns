Design Pattern   | Chapter | Purpose
:--------------- | ------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy Pattern |       1 | Defines a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulating each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
Observer Pattern |       2 | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
